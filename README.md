CCT211 Project 2: Food Finder
Our GUI program helps our user find their favourite foods in the GTA. Upon opening the app the user sees their blank dashboard. Clicking the plus button allows the user to search for food. The search page consists of three areas, location, cuisine, and dietary restriction. The user can select any combination of options to find the food they want. Upon hitting search a list of possible options comes up allowing the user to save specific results. Results do not unfortunately save immediately, the user must close the app and re-open the app to view saved results. The user can also delete any results they would like. 
Files needed to run the application - sql.py, project.db, FoodFinder Homepage.py
